  roleDescription:
    "As an Enterprise Systems Engineer at Waydev, I helped engineering leaders gain visibility into their work and align it with business initiatives. Previously, I was a Kasten Presales Specialist, where I exceeded my monthly sales growth targets and KPIs by cultivating relationships with executive-level decision-makers and demonstrating the value of Kasten solutions. I also collaborated with sales enablement teams to create internal sales processes, tools, and visual assets and implemented standardized reporting and forecasting templates.  I am passionate about learning new technologies and staying updated on the latest trends and best practices in the cloud and Kubernetes domains. I am a native English speaker and I enjoy working with diverse and cross-functional teams and contributing to the success of our customers and partners.",
